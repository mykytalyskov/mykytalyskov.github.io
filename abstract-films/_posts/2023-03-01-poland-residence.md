description: |
    In January, I was lucky to become a member of the residence for artists in Klementovice (Poland). 
    I spent a pleasant 10 days there and drew 574 drawings, which later became this animation. 
    It turned out to be an interesting experiment, since during the residence 
    I did not use animated gadgets, such as a lightbox or a computer, only paints and paper.
